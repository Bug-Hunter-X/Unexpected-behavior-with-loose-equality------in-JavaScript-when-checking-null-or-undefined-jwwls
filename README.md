This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to loose equality (==) when dealing with null and undefined values.  The function `foo` intends to handle null values gracefully, returning 0. However, when called with `undefined`, it produces `NaN` due to the loose comparison.  The solution illustrates the importance of using strict equality (===) for reliable comparisons and type checking.
